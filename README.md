## 🚧 Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [SQLite 3+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work.

## 📝 Features

- Create a queue for players to join and get notified once all 5 slots have been filled.
- Server id storage so that a single player can join independent queues across servers!
- Set a channel for the bot to send messages so the whole server doesnt need to be notified.
- Clearing out the queue if a player does not appear
- Auto queue reset at midnight so there isnt and old queue!
- List all the players in the queue 

## 📕 Commands
